### Hi there 😃😵‍💫

I'm Scott 👋, I am a Staff Frontend Engineer

I started my career strong in CSS and HTML. I grew to learn JavaScript and React. Today I am a well rounded frontend engineer. I am an advocate for Next.js, Tailwind, Vanilla Extract and TypeScript.

I believe in the AHA principles _(Avoid Hasty Abstractions)_, code simplicity and leveraging for free what the browser gives you.



Currently interested in:
- Learning Go
- UI, Accessibility, React, Next.js, Tailwind, Vanilla Extract, Golang

In my free time I:
- Powerlift
- Build keyboards
